# Drum Kit Web Application

## Overview
This project is a simple **Drum Kit Web Application** where users can play drum sounds by either clicking buttons on the screen or pressing specific keys on the keyboard. Each button or key triggers a different drum sound, allowing users to simulate playing a drum kit.

The project is built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** and features a visually appealing design with interactive animations for a more engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Interactive Drum Buttons:** Users can click on buttons labeled `w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, and `l` to play different drum sounds.
- **Keyboard Support:** Pressing the corresponding keys (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, and `l`) on the keyboard also triggers the drum sounds.
- **Audio Feedback:** Each button and key is linked to a specific drum sound, including toms, snare, crash, and kick bass.
- **Visual Feedback:** Buttons provide a visual animation when pressed or clicked.
- **Drum Logo Easter Egg:** Clicking the drum logo at the top of the page plays a fun sound effect (`baDumTss`).

## Technologies Used
- **HTML:** The structure of the web page.
- **CSS:** Styling for the page, including custom fonts, background colors, and button designs.
- **JavaScript:** Logic for handling the interaction between the user (mouse clicks and keyboard presses) and the drum sounds.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the drum kit interface.
- `styles.css`: Provides the styling for the webpage, including animations and button designs.
- `index.js`: Contains the JavaScript code to handle click events, keyboard events, and sound playback.
- `images/`: Directory for storing the images used as button backgrounds.
- `sounds/`: Directory for storing the drum sounds in `.mp3` format.

## How to Use
1. **Clone or download** the repository to your local machine.
2. **Ensure** that the `sounds/` directory contains the following sound files:
   - `tom-1.mp3`
   - `tom-2.mp3`
   - `tom-3.mp3`
   - `tom-4.mp3`
   - `snare.mp3`
   - `crash.mp3`
   - `kick-bass.mp3`
   - `ba-dum-tss-2s.mp3`
3. **Ensure** that the `images/` directory contains the following images for button backgrounds:
   - `tom1.png`
   - `tom2.png`
   - `tom3.png`
   - `tom4.png`
   - `snare.png`
   - `crash.png`
   - `kick.png`
4. **Open** the `index.html` file in your browser.
5. **Click** the drum buttons on the screen or press the corresponding keys on your keyboard (`w`, `a`, `s`, `d`, `j`, `k`, `l`) to play different drum sounds.

## Future Enhancements
- Adding more sounds and animations for an expanded drum kit.
- Implementing mobile touch support for a better experience on touch devices.
- Creating a visual metronome or beat indicator for rhythm practice.
